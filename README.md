Laravel & Ember Starter Kit
===========================

> A boiler plate for writing web apps using Laravel and Ember

Overview
---------

After creating several projects, I started to notice a pattern in what it takes to begin and continue developing using both Ember and Laravel. Though this is based on my current work flow, I am certain there are ways it could be improved and augmented. Please feel free to help. 

Goals
-----

- ~~Integrate Ember tasks into Artisan commands (php artisan generate:model --Ember:true)~~
- Integrate Ember-Laravel Generator [generator-ember-laravel](https://github.com/cullymason/generator-ember-laravel)
- Extend Laravel Model so that it spits out Ember Friendly JSON described in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/cullymason/6198667)
- âˆš Integrate a JS package manager (Bower maybe?)
- Keep it stream lined but easily expandable. 

Todo's & Wish List
